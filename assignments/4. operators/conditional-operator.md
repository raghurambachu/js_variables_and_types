## If Statement
1.  üéñMake a simple calculator with these functions. Using prompt, type conversion, if else statement. Use prompt to take the input from user i.e two numbers and an operation (Add, Sub, Mul, Div).

  ‚õë Rule
    * [ ] While substracting and dividing keep in mind the number one should be greater then number two. If not show alert saying `Number Two is larger then Number one`.
  ‚ö°Ô∏è Operations
    * [ ] Add
    * [ ] Sub
    * [ ] Mul
    * [ ] Div

let operation = prompt("Enter the operation you want to perform ?");
if (
  operation === "Add" ||
  operation === "Sub" ||
  operation === "Mul" ||
  operation === "Div"
) {
  let input1 = +prompt("Enter the First Number");
  let input2 = +prompt("Enter the Second Number");
  let result;
  if ((operation === "Sub" || operation === "Div") && input1 < input2) {
    alert(
      "For Subtraction and Division the First Number should be larger than the Second Number"
    );
  } else {
    if (operation === "Add") {
      result = input1 + input2;
    } else if (operation === "Sub") {
      result = input1 - input2;
    } else if (operation === "Mul") {
      result = input1 * input2;
    } else {
      result = input1 / input2;
    }
    console.log(result);
  }
} else {
  alert(
    operation +
      "cannot be performed by the calculator. Please Enter valid operations ie 'Add', 'Sub','Mul','Div'"
  );
}

2. üéñWrite a if else statement which checks if the status is single `console.log` the message `John is single` or else `John is married`
```js
var firstName = 'John';
var status = 'single';
// Your code goes here
```
var firstName = "John";
var status = "married";
if(status === "single"){
  console.log(firstName + " is single")
}else{
  console.log(firstName + " is married")
}


3. üéñWrite a JavaScript program that takes two `integers` from user (using prompt) and alerts the larger number.
```js
// your code goes here
```
let number1 = +prompt("Enter the first integer");
let number2 = +prompt("Enter the second integer");
if(isNaN(number1) || isNaN(number2)){
  alert("Please enter valid integers.")
}else{
  let larger;
  if(number1 > number2){
    larger = number1;
  }else if(number2 > number1){
    larger = number2
  }else{
    larger ="Inputted integers are equal. Neither of them is larger."
  }
  alert(larger);
}


4. üéñWrite a JavaScript conditional statement to find the sign (+, -) of product of three numbers. Take those three numbers from user using `prompt`. Display an alert box with the specified sign.

```js
// Your code goes here
```
// +++ +
// ++- -
// +-+ -
// +-- +
// -++ -
// -+- +
// --+ +
// --- -

let inputNum1 = +prompt("Enter the first number","");
let inputNum2 = +prompt("Enter the second number","");
let inputNum3 = +prompt("Enter the third number","");
if (
  (inputNum1 > 0 && inputNum2 > 0 && inputNum3 > 0) ||
  (inputNum1 > 0 && inputNum2 < 0 && inputNum3 < 0) ||
  (inputNum1 < 0 && inputNum2 > 0 && inputNum3 < 0) ||
  (inputNum1 < 0 && inputNum2 < 0 && inputNum3 > 0)
) {
  alert("The sign of the resultant multiplication would be" + " + positive");
} else {
  alert("The sign of the resultant multiplication would be" + " - negative");
}



## Switch Statement

1. üéñUsing switch statement do the following

Take a number value from user and alert the message if it matches the conditions.
* [ ] ONE, if `number` is equal to 1.
* [ ] TWO, if `number` is equal to 2.
* [ ] THREE, if `number` is equal to 3.
* [ ] FOUR, if `number` is equal to 4.
* [ ] FIVE, if `number` is equal to 5.
* [ ] SIX, if `number` is equal to 6.
* [ ] SEVEN, if `number` is equal to 7.
* [ ] EIGHT, if `number` is equal to 8.
* [ ] NINE, if `number` is equal to 9.
* [ ] PLEASE TRY AGAIN, if  is none of the above.
```js
// Your code goes here
```

let userInput = +prompt("Put some number in between 1 to 9");
let numberAlert;
switch(userInput){
  case 1:
    numberAlert = "ONE";
    break;
  case 2:
    numberAlert = "TWO";
    break;
  case 3:
    numberAlert = "THREE";
    break;
  case 4:
    numberAlert = "FOUR";
    break;
  case 5:
    numberAlert = "FIVE";
    break;
  case 6:
    numberAlert = "SIX";
    break;
  case 7:
    numberAlert = "SEVEN";
    break;
  case 8:
    numberAlert = "EIGHT";
    break;
  case 9:
    numberAlert = "NINE";
    break;
  default:
    numberAlert = "PLEASE TRY AGAIN";
}
alert(numberAlert);


2. üéñUsing switch statement do the following

Take the value of `marks` (0-100) from user using `prompt` and `alert` the message (Your Grade is AA) as giver below.
* [ ] `AA` if `marks` is greater than 90.
* [ ] `AB` if `marks` is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90
* [ ] `BB` if `marks` is greater than 70 and less than or equal to 80
* [ ] `BC` if `marks` is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70
* [ ] `CC` if `marks` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60
* [ ] `CD` if `marks` is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50
* [ ] `DD` if `marks` is greater than 30 and less than or equal to 40
* [ ] `FF` if `marks` is less than or equal to 30
```js
// Your code goes here
```
let marks = +prompt("Enter the marks between 0 and 100");
let grade;
if(marks < 0 || marks > 100){
  alert("Please enter valid marks in between 0 and 100");
}else{
  switch(true){
    case (marks <= 30):
      grade = "FF";
      break;
    case (marks <= 40):
      grade = "DD";
      break;
    case (marks <= 50):
      grade = "CD";
      break;
    case (marks <= 60):
      grade = "CC";
      break;
    case (marks <= 70):
      grade = "BC";
      break;
    case (marks <= 80):
      grade = "BB";
      break;
    case (marks <= 90):
      grade = "AB";
      break;
    case (marks <= 100):
      grade = "AA";
      break;
  }
  alert("Congratulations your grade is " + grade)
}
